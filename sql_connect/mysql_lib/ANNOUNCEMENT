--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear MySQL Users,

A new GA (general availability) version of MySQL Connector/C++ has
been made available: MySQL Connector/C++ 1.1.6 GA. The MySQL
Connector/C++ provides a C++ API for connecting client applications to
the MySQL Server 5.5 or newer. You can download the production release
at:

 http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/1.1.html

The MySQL driver for C++ offers an easy to use API derived from JDBC
4.0. MySQL Workbench is using it successfully since years.

The major changes in 1.1.6 are:

  Security Notes

     * Connector/C++ 1.1.6 Commercial upgrades the linked OpenSSL
       library to version 1.0.1m which has been publicly reported
       as not vulnerable to CVE-2015-0286
       (http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0286).

   Functionality Added or Changed

     * The std::auto_ptr class template is deprecated in C++11,
       and its usage has been replaced with
       boost::scoped_ptr/shared_ptr.
       The CMAKE_ENABLE_C++11 CMake option has been added to
       permit enabling C++11 support. (Bug #75251)

     * Connector/C++ now provides macros to indicate the
       versions of libraries against which it was built:
       MYCPPCONN_STATIC_MYSQL_VERSION and
       MYCPPCONN_STATIC_MYSQL_VERSION_ID (MySQL client library
       version, string and numeric), and MYCPPCONN_BOOST_VERSION
       (Boost library version, numeric). (Bug #75250)

   Bugs Fixed

     * With defaultStatementResultType=FORWARD_ONLY and a row
       position after the last row, using getter methods such as
       getInt() or getString() resulted in a segmentation fault.
       (Bug #20085944)

     * For prepared statements, calling wasNull() before
       fetching data resulted in an assertion failure.
       (Bug #19938873)

     * Result sets from prepared statements were not freed.
       (Bug #18135088)

     * MySQL Connector/C++ failed to build against
       Boost-devel-1.41.0-25 on OLE6.
       (Bug #75063, Bug #20125824)

     * Configuration failed if the MYSQL_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE
       option was specified and the MySQL installation path
       contained the characters -m. Installation failed if the
       build directory was not in the top source directory.
       (Bug #73502, Bug #19447498)

     * For prepared statements, getString() did not return the
       fractional seconds part from temporal columns that had a
       fractional sections part. (Bug #68523, Bug #17218692)

     * For queries of the form SELECT MAX(bit_col) FROM
       table_with_bit_col, getString() returned an incorrect
       result. (Bug #66235, Bug #14520822)

     * For Connector/C++ builds from source, make install failed
       if only the static library had been built without the
       dynamic library. (Bug #52281, Bug #11759926)
